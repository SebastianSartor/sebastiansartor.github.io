I genuinely love to inspire and support others. It gives me so much to see other's succeed and follow their dreams which constantly motivates me to further share experiences and knowledge. Many things come and go, but this is probably something that will stick until I die. 
I currently track talks on my <a href="https://sebastian-sartor.notion.site/Talks-Presentations-Co-b6ad47f882274c19875cacb7b1c62790?pvs=4">Notion</a> page.
