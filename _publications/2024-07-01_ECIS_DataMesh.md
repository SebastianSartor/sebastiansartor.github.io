title: "DATA MESH - A CASE STUDY PERSPECTIVE ON
BUILDING INDUSTRIAL DATA PLATFORMS"
collection: publications
#permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
#excerpt: 'In an era where data is the new currency, organizations are contending to harness vast data influxes
for data-driven innovation. Centralized data architectures, with extensive data warehouses and lakes,
are buckling under the pressure of contextually complex and distributed demands, leading to data
bottlenecks and alignment issues within organizational structures. Data Mesh emerges as a
decentralized paradigm promising to surmount these hurdles by advocating domain ownership and
federated governance. This research delves into the practicalities of Data Mesh through a case study of
Alpha, a German manufacturing firm, revealing a transformative shift towards a data-driven modus
operandi. It details Alpha's journey from siloed data storage to a unified, transparent data platform that
repositions IT as an innovation linchpin. Bridging the theoretical and practical, the paper underscores
Data Mesh's potential to amalgamate decentralized data ownership with central oversight, offering a
roadmap for organizations to navigate the data-centric future effectively.'
