I like empowering others. Regardless of inspiring them to do something, to share concrete knowledge that may help them, or to educate them with skills. I also find satisfaction in the notion that I can positively influence someone, whether through a small gesture or by providing support for their aspirations. It can start with a friendly smile and potentially lead to a meaningful impact. I genuinely appreciate these opportunities!
I currently track my teaching involvements on my [notion](https://sebastian-sartor.notion.site/Teaching-9a27d36495204e2c9baf68f9550bd48c?pvs=4) page.
