Hi, IÂ´m Sebastian! 

IÂ´m a Master student at the Technical University of Munich, majoring in Management & Technology with specializing on Innovation & Entrepreneurship and Computer Science. At the same time Iâ€˜m affiliated with the FututeTech lab at MIT CSAIL as a visiting researcher. 

This webpage is work in progress.
