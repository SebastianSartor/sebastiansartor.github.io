Hi, IÂ´m Sebastian!

IÂ´m a Master student at the Technical University of Munich, majoring in Management & Technology with specializing on Computer Science and Innovation & Entrepreneurship. At the same time Iâ€˜m affiliated with the MIT CSAIL FutureTech lab.

As part of my past, present and future research endeavors, I aim to better understand technological progress, to make technology and their applications better and to assess the implications from technology innovation. My aspiration is to empower individuals with the ability to achieve what was once impossible, utilizing technology as a tool of enablement. I envision a world streamlined to eliminate unnecessary inefficiencies, providing people the freedom to focus on activities they find enjoyable, rather than monotonous and unfulfilling work.

Previously, I pushed innovation and entrepreneurship education at UnternehmerTUM and at the Center for Digital Technology and Management (CDTM). I studied at UC Berkeley for a semester during my Masters and completed my Bachelor studies in Mechnical Engineering and Business Administration at the University of Bayreuth, Germany. During that time I co-founded and led a team building an autonomous system for an electric race car competing at Formula Student competitions.

If you catch me outside of work, Iâ€™m an adventurous traveler (42 countries and counting), a casual Volleyball player and Cyclist (yes, I got three bicycles) and a passionate skier (yep, have been an instructor too). I also like to meet friends for a game night, cooking sessions, going out or day trips to nearby lakes and mountains. IÂ´m always on the hunt for new experiences (e.g. background movie acting, analog photography, diving, water skiing, â€¦). Besides that, I love to talk about almost everything but among my favorite topics are traveling, Startups, deep talk topics on personal development, the future, human existence and philosophy, and my research of course (or anyhing technology innovation related).

You can find more about my professional background on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-sartor/), my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qrTsOTYAAAAJ&hl=en) and travel pictures on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sebastian_sartor/).

I barely miss to answer any message and try to respond quicklyðŸ˜Š
