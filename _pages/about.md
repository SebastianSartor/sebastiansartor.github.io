Hi, IÂ´m Sebastian!

IÂ´m a 1st year doctoral student at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). At the same time, IÂ´m part of the Management Team at the Center for Digital Technology and Management (CDTM) and affiliated with MIT CSAIL FutureTech lab. 

My goal is to explore the technological trends and limitations of advanced AI systems and general-purpose robots. By understanding these factors, I aim to contribute to the development of better systems, fostering a streamlined world free from unnecessary inefficiencies, and allowing people to focus on enjoyable activities rather than monotonous work. At the same time, by exploring the implications and making technological advancements transparent I hope to mitigate negative consequences and pave the way for a future where technology serves humanity meaningfully. My research focuses on compute, data, model size, neural scaling laws, autonomous agents, benchmarking, open-source AI, the economics of AI, and AI policy.

Key questions driving my research include:
> When will we have superintelligent AI systems and general-purpose robotics in our households, similar to cars today?
> How will our lives change with these systems?
> What will our systems look like in 10 years, and what will they be capable of?
> Does scaling current architectural designs lead to superintelligent systems in both virtual and physical worlds?
> What comes after the development of superintelligent autonomous systems?
> Will these advancements lead to a better or worse future?

Previously, I finished my Masters in Management & Technology at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), collaborated with Neil Thompson from the MIT FutureTech lab, spend a semester abroad at UC Berkeley and supported innovation and entrepreneurship education at UnternehmerTUM and at the Center for Digital Technology and Management (CDTM). During my Masters, I also published two peer-reviewed papers, two preprints and contributed to a book. I completed my Bachelor studies in Mechnical Engineering and Business Administration at the University of Bayreuth, Germany. During that time I co-founded and led a team building an autonomous system for an electric race car competing at Formula Student competitions.

If you catch me outside of work, Iâ€™m an adventurous traveler (42 countries and counting), a casual Volleyball player and Cyclist (yes, I got three bicycles, worked once as bike mechanic too) and a passionate skier (yep, have been an instructor too). I also like to meet friends for a game night, cooking sessions, going out or full day trips to nearby lakes and mountains. IÂ´m always on the hunt for new experiences and hobbies (e.g. background movie acting, analog photography, diving, water skiing, â€¦) and I love preparing pranks and surprises. Besides that, I love to talk about almost everything but among my favorite topics are traveling, personal development (yes, I love deep talk and philosophical questions), Startups, and my research of course (or anything technology innovation related, really!).
